# sat-cdcl-solver

To run our solver you only need to have python installed. We are using __Python 3.8.5__ and it should work with this and newer. We believe it will work with older versions but we do not guarentee.

To run on a specific file run 
```python main.py <path to file>```

For example if you are in the root directory of this repository you can run ```python main.py project1-revised-tests/sat/block0.cnf```
